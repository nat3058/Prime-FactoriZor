# Prime-Factorization
A program that prime factorizes an given number by using recurision...since doing prime factorization by hand looks very similar to a tree data structure

# To-Do:
- write out the ReadMe in Emacs
- follow the tips on the other websites 
- mention that this program is self checking (aka it will validate the results)
- meant to handle large numbers if necessary, 
- run time is not necessarily longer for larger numbers (run time is more dependent on the funkiness of the prime factors)
- took me about 9ish hours to build (kinda slow)
- Future versions:
    - make it faster (somehow)
    - add ANSI colors to the terminal output so it looks nice too look it
    - output the values as a tree structure diagram (like humans do when doing prime factorization by hand)
    - make a python version of this code but with multi threading (blindingly fast!)
